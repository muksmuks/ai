OpenAI's internal five-step plan for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) provides a structured framework for tracking progress in AI
development. The plan outlines five levels of AI capability, starting from
- Conversational AI (Level 1)
- Reasoners,
- Autonomous Agents
- Innovators,
- AI systems capable of functioning as entire organizations (Level 5)

OpenAI currently considers itself at Level 1 and approaching Level 2, which represents AI systems that can solve problems at a doctorate level of education
This roadmap is considered a work in progress and may evolve based on feedback and advancements in AI technology


#### Conversational AI
The first level of OpenAI's AGI roadmap focuses on conversational AI, which represents the current state of the company's technology.
At this stage, AI systems excel at engaging in natural, human-like conversations, demonstrating a
foundational understanding and the ability to respond to a wide range of prompts and questions.
This level is exemplified by models like ChatGPT, which can interact with users in
a conversational manner across various topics. While impressive, this stage is just the beginning
of the journey towards AGI, with OpenAI acknowledging that significant advancements are still needed to
reach more sophisticated levels of artificial intelligence


#### Problem-Solving Virtuosos
The second level of OpenAI's AGI roadmap introduces "Reasoners" - AI systems capable of
solving complex problems with the proficiency of human experts. These systems are expected to perform problem-solving
tasks as well as a person with a PhD-level education, without access to external resources.
This milestone represents a significant leap from mimicking human behavior to demonstrating
genuine intellectual prowess. OpenAI believes it is approaching this level, which marks a crucial transition in
AI capabilities towards more advanced reasoning and problem-solving skills

#### Autonomous Agents
At the third level of OpenAI's AGI roadmap, "Agents" emerge as AI systems capable of operating autonomously for extended periods.
These advanced models can spend several days acting on a user's behalf, taking on complex tasks,
making decisions, and adapting to changing circumstances without constant human oversight.
This level represents a significant leap in AI autonomy and practical utility, potentially revolutionizing
industries by handling intricate operations independently. The development of such agents marks
a crucial step towards more sophisticated AI applications, bridging the gap between problem-solving capabilities
and the ability to function as independent entities in real-world scenarios.


#### Innovators
The fourth level of OpenAI's AGI roadmap introduces "Innovators" - AI systems capable of developing
groundbreaking ideas and solutions across various fields.
This stage represents a significant leap forward, as it signifies AI's ability to drive innovation and progress independently

#### Organizational Equivalents
The pinnacle of the roadmap, Level 5, envisions AI "Organizations" that can function as entire entities,
possessing strategic thinking, operational efficiency, and adaptability to manage complex systems and achieve
organizational goals. While these advanced levels remain theoretical,
they represent the ultimate ambition of AI researchers and highlight the potential for AI to
revolutionize industries and organizational structures in the future.
