In traditional AI, agents are defined as entities that perceive and act upon their environment [5].
In the LLM era, the term is used in a narrower way (a thermostat would qualify as an agent under
the traditional definition).

Many researchers have tried to formalize the community’s intuitive
understanding of what constitutes an agent in the context of language-model-based systems. Many of
them view it as a spectrum — sometimes denoted by the term ‘agentic’ [4] — rather than a binary
definition of an agent.

Let's identify the factors that cause an AI system to be considered
more agentic according to existing definitions. There are three clusters of factors.

#### Environment and goals.
The more complex the environment — e.g. range of tasks and domains,
multi-stakeholder, long time horizon, unexpected changes — the more AI systems operating in that
environment are agentic [6, 3]. Systems that pursue complex goals without being instructed on
how to pursue the goal are more agentic [6, 1, 3].

#### User interface and supervision.
AI systems that can be instructed in natural language and act
autonomously on the user’s behalf are more agentic [3]. In particular, systems that require less
user supervision are more agentic [6, 1, 3].

#### System design
Systems that use design patterns such as tool use (e.g., web search, programming)
or planning (e.g., reflection, subgoal decomposition) are more agentic [7, 4]. Systems whose
control flow is driven by an LLM, and hence dynamic, are more agentic [7, 2].
