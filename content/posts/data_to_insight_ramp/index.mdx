Universe is a ‘hard disk’ full of stimuli. Human brain, transforms these stimuli into data, and data into information, through the cognitive functions. Through
the information we receive, we start the hunt of acquiring more and more knowledge.

Ackoff (1989) in his article **[1] From Data to Wisdom**  proposed a model (wisdom hierarchy) including the following levels:

**Data --> Information --> Knowledge --> Insight --> Wisdom**

His model could be considered as pyramid as each level includes the previous levels.

Analogously, through software systems, we have created means to capture data, the persuit remains to gain knowledge, insight and wisdom
in an efficient way and cost-effective way. Efficiency implies
- Time taken to arrive at an actionable insight
- Reliability of the insight

LLM and [Reasoning model](https://ai.mukeshkr.me/reasoners/) provides **agency** (autonomous) to further reduce the time.

With LLM, we have language based world model which can predict output given a natural language ask. Through it training over large internet level data,
it has learned the latent rules which underlie human language.

Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system,
LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:
- Planning (sub-goal, decomposition, reflection and refinement)
- Memory (short-term : in-context, long-term: retain and recall over extended periods)
- Tool use (Means to bring current information, access to proprietary information sources and more)

These two technologies together provide an means to add *agency* (autonomous) to the journey from data to insight, which almost seems magical.

With these AI transformative tools, it seems everything is figured out. Right? **Wrong**

While the pieces are there, scaffolding is missing. This article will present
- participants in the journey
- How it was being done in the user driven approach

**The aim is to bring forward unique characteristic of such implementations and the need for those. The understanding provides
feature mapping when we introduce agents and hence argue about shortcomings and approach around those.**


### The Participants

![](./assets/participants.png)

### DataSources
Enterprises has data in different form
- Transactional data (Accessible via API)
- Analytical data (Structured, Semi-structured or Unstructured)

### Process Knowledge
Which data are needed for insight and how to bring the data. This can be referred to as orchestration
These knowledge is present in product documentations, expert's process knowledge

### Domain Knowledge
How different concepts relate to each other. Experts inject this meaning to data through ontology

> In knowledge representation and AI, an ontology is a formal, structured description of knowledge — it defines the concepts (entities), relationships, and rules that describe a particular domain.
Put simply, it’s a schema for meaning — a way to tell machines what things exist, how they relate, and what constraints apply.

### Goals
When we need to analyse data, certain amount of probing is required. Probing needs goals in expert's mind based on the domain of interest. Different domains
would have different goals in mind. For example CSM would be interested in customer churn and indicators capturing those.

In traditional Data Science, this is referred to as dimensions.

### Explaining a pattern
Once an insight has been presented, there is often a need to understand the why. For eg if in product quality, if the number of
tickets have dipped suddenly, the need to understand the why can indicate a holiday month like Christmas.

Traditional ML techniques like anomaly detection has been used to understand the underlying cause
